# Smoothing Techniques in Time Series Analysis ðŸ“ˆ

## Overview ðŸš€

This repository contains the code and documentation for the group project on "Smoothing Techniques in Time Series Analysis." The project explores various smoothing techniques applied to three different datasets: Sunspot dataset, Stock Market, and Air passenger dataset. The results are visualized using animations, and additional analyses include autocorrelation functions, partial autocorrelation functions, and an introduction to the ETS model in R.
